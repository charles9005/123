HW: Beta

*Environment information / test conditions*
DUT: Evolve2 30 MS Mono USB-C v1.4.1, Evolve2 30 UC Stereo USB-A v1.4.1

*Steps to reproduce / failure sequence*
1. Connect HS to PC via cable
2. Run Amazon Chime and MS Teams on the PC
3. Establish an active call on Amazon Chime
4. Make an incoming call from ESP to MS Teams ==>Then the active call on Amazon Chime would be ended automatically > Fail


*Expected result / Requirement*
The active call on Amazon Chime should not be ended automatically when gets incoming call from Teams


*Actual result / Failure mode*
The active call on Amazon Chime will be ended automatically when gets incoming call from Teams


*Error rate*
100%


*Additional information that might be relevant*
1. The same on Teams active call + Amazon Chime incoming call
2. The same on Amazon Chime active call + Zoom incoming call

In order to address this issue , Strategic Alliance has to check with respective SPs clients for HID signalling.

Compare to Plantronics C5220 USB-C, it works well.

Compare to Charles with link380/Frig, the same wrong behavior.
